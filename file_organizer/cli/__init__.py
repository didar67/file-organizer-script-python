cli package initializer
-----------------------
This package handles all Command-Line Interface (CLI) functionalities
for the File Organizer project.

Modules:
    cli_handler.py â€“ Parses user arguments (e.g., --path, --config, --dry-run)
                     and initializes runtime settings for the application.

Purpose:
    This file ensures Python recognizes the 'cli' directory as a package.
    It also helps maintain modular project structure for future scalability.
